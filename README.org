These are my Go solutions to [[https://cryptopals.com/][the cryptopals challenges]]. The solution to each
problem is split between a file named =SXCY.go=, and a test case named
=SXCY_test.go=, where the values of =X= and =Y= correspond to the set and
challenge number. For example, the solution to Set 2 Challenge 9 is found in the
files =s2c9.go= and =s2c9_test.go=.

To run all test cases use =go test -v= or =make=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Run tests
$ go test -v

# The same, but using make
$ make
#+END_SRC

I am releasing all of this code under the GPLv3+ license, except where otherwise
noted:

 - The file =ecb.go= was taken from [[https://codereview.appspot.com/7860047][Go CL 7860047]].
