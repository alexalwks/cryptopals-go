Idea: flip the low bit in the second to last byte in a block. If the block still
has valid padding, then the last byte must be 01h. If invalid, flip the third to
last byte in the block. If the block is still valid, the block ends with 0202h.
Try the next bit, if so it ends with 030303h, etc. In this way we can find the
padding byte (and know how many there are).

For the last block, now make add one more padding byte.

Next: for any arbitrary block, try all 256 ways of flipping the bits in the last
byte. Truncate any following blocks, and provide this to the oracle. One of the
ways will set the byte to 01h. Based on the mask we applied, we can figure out
what the cleartext last byte was. Now set it to 02h and proceed to the next
byte. For the first block, we do the same thing but use the IV was the zeroth
block.
